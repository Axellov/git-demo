Can you see all of me?
Walk into my mystery
Step inside and hold on for dear life
Do you remember me?

Capture you or set you free
I am all, I am all of me

I bet you feel it now, baby
Especially since we've only known each other one day
But, I've gotta work shit out, baby
I'm exercising demons, got 'em runnin' 'round the block now
