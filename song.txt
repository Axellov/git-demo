Can you see all of me?
Walk into my mystery
Step inside and hold on for dear life
Do you remember me?

Capture you or set you free
I am all, I am all of me
skibidi toilet
riz ohio fanum tax

Oh the weather outside is rizzy
But the fire is so skibidi
Since we've no place to go
Ohi, Ohio,Ohio

I bet you feel it now, baby
Especially since we've only known each other one day
But, I've gotta work shit out, baby
I'm exercising demons, got 'em runnin' 'round the block now

The water's getting colder, let me in your ocean, swim
Out in California, I'll be forward stroking, swim
So hard to ignore ya, 'specially when I'm smoking, swim
