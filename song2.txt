Yeah
The water's getting colder, let me in your ocean, swim
Out in California, I'll be forward stroking, swim
So hard to ignore ya, 'specially when I'm smoking, swim
World is on my shoulders, keep your body open, swim
I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah
I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah
Out in California, I'll be forward stroking, swim
So hard to ignore ya, keep your body open, swim

I hate Chase Atlantic ig
(Bullshit btw)
