I bet you feel it now, baby
Especially since we've only known each other one day
But, I've gotta work shit out, baby
I'm exercising demons, got 'em runnin' 'round the block now
Location drop, now
Pedal to the floor like you're runnin' from the cops now
Oh, what a cop out
You picked a dance with the devil and you lucked out
